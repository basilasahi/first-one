    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h3> Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for<br/>
         about an hour now. On her desk, lying between<br/>
          the copies of <i> Nature,</i> <i>New Scientist,</i><br/>
           and all the other scientific journals her work had<br/>
            appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite><br/>
                On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite<br/>
                 book since college, and the longer she spent <br/>
    in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free. </p>
<p>
    She had spend last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster<br/> 
    with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaming that <q> Work is the refuge of <br/>
        people who have nothing beter to do<br/>
    </q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the<br/>
     secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid" >DNA</abbr><br/>
     , to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em> did</em> think she had<br/> something beter to do.
